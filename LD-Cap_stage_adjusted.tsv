1.5050	0.32	0.32	0	12/31/2018	Staff gauge installed. Reference initial elevation, which Leah and Andy approximated for her thesis to correspond to water depth = 0 at stage = 10 cm.
0.7230	0.22	0.33	0.11	1/5/2020	Offset = +0.111 based on max 30 cm observed total aggradation initial install -- at staff gauge, so in eddy. Daniel unburied ~10 cm. Guessing he dug down a bit more, so 25 cm total aggradation (split difference) over 4.5 yrs, ~4.5 cm/yr.
0.6030	0.21	0.32	0.11	6/21/2022	Seems to match no major aggradation or incision since last period. Without further info, just leave as-is.

0.6766	0.21	0.4525	0.24	25 Jun 2023 b	Crystal measured 0.26 m and 0.27 m (repeat measurements) for water depth at gauge when stage was 45.5 cm. This was after Daniel dug it out 10 cm, but unknown if he dug deeper. This was in an eddy with excess sedimentation, so approximating 5 cm of what he removed was real deposition gives us 45.5 - (26.5 - 5) = 24 cm.
