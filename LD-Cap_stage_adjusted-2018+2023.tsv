1.5050	0.32	0.32	0	12/31/2018	Staff gauge installed. Reference initial elevation, which Leah and Andy approximated for her thesis to correspond to water depth = 0 at stage = 10 cm.

0.6766	0.21	0.4525	0.24	25 Jun 2023 b	Crystal measured 0.26 m and 0.27 m (repeat measurements) for water depth at gauge when stage was 45.5 cm. This was after Daniel dug it out 10 cm, but unknown if he dug deeper. This was in an eddy with excess sedimentation, so approximating 5 cm of what he removed was real deposition gives us 45.5 - (26.5 - 5) = 24 cm.
